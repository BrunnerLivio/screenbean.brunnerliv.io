## Motivation

At my company I often tried to promote my websites "nicely". Unfortunately, my co-workers (managers and fellow devs) have a hard time to do so. In order to make things easier for myself, as well as my fellow colleagues I've created ScreenBean!

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- Yarn installed

## Run the application locally

Run the following commands in your shell of choice

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrunnerLivio/screenbean.brunnerliv.io.git
cd screenbean.brunnerliv.io
yarn
yarn start
```


## Create a production build

Make sure you are in the projects folder

```bash
yarn run build
```
